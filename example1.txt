Hi! I'm R.L. Stine and my job is to terrify kids. You might know me as the bestselling author of Goosebumps, but you can call be Bob.
Here's proof that it's me: https://twitter.com/RL_Stine/status/793073897608515584
I'm the author of more than three hundred books, including the Goosebumps Series.
My series R.L. Stine's The Haunting Hour returns to Discovery Family Channel today starting at 5 PM ET.
Ask me anything!
